- ### Project Overview
  ---

The "Netflix Shows Analysis (2011-2017)" project is a comprehensive exploration of Netflix's content during a pivotal period. With the advent of streaming services, Netflix began reshaping the entertainment industry. This project delves into the shows that were part of this transformation from 2011 to 2017.
This data analysis project aims to explore and gain insights into Netflix shows released between 2011 and 2017. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in a Jupyter Notebook, we will examine various factors, including the distribution of content over the years, show types, country-wise content, top genres, and show ratings. The findings will provide a comprehensive view of Netflix's content during this critical period.

### Recommendations
  

Based on the insights gathered from the analysis of Netflix content between 2011 and 2017, the following recommendations can be made:

- Diversify TV Shows: While movies are prevalent on Netflix, there is an opportunity to diversify and expand the library of TV shows. Consider investing in original and engaging TV series to attract a wider audience, especially viewers who prefer episodic content.

- Global Partnerships: Given the significant contribution of the United States to Netflix content, continue collaborating with U.S.-based production companies and creators. Additionally, explore partnerships and content acquisition from other countries to further diversify the platform.

- Content Ratings: Recognizing that TV-MA is the highest-rated category with the highest count, focus on producing content that caters to mature audiences while ensuring content in other rating categories is also available to meet various age group preferences.

- Documentaries: Given the popularity of documentaries, consider producing more high-quality documentary content that covers a wide range of topics. This genre has a broad appeal and can attract a diverse audience.



### Contributions
In line with the insights gained, Netflix could collaborate with content creators, production companies, and filmmakers to achieve the following:

- Content Diversity: Collaborate with global filmmakers and production companies to create diverse content, including TV shows, to cater to a wider international audience.

- Original Series: Collaborate with creative talents to produce unique and engaging TV series that can capture the attention of viewers who prefer serialized storytelling.

- Quality Documentaries: Partner with documentary filmmakers and researchers to develop high-quality documentaries on a variety of topics, ensuring that this popular genre continues to thrive on the platform.

- Viewer-Driven Content: Collaborate with content creators to produce shows and movies that align with viewer preferences and demographic data to maintain and expand Netflix's global reach.

By following these recommendations and engaging in strategic collaborations, Netflix can continue to provide an extensive and diverse content library that meets the evolving demands and interests of its subscribers. üì∫ü§ù #Netflix #ContentStrategy #Contributions

### Limitations
Using Seaborn to obtain the visualization was a lot, so I decided to run a few of the visualizations with Matplotlib libraries for me to get the visualizations 
ready to go with the kind of data I had in my dataset.
